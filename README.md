# Finding-Lane-Lines-on-the-Road

Identifying lanes on the road is a common task performed by all human drivers to ensure their vehicles are within lane constraints when driving, so as to make sure traffic is smooth and minimize chances of collisions with other cars due to lane misalignment.

Similarly, it is a critical task for an autonomous vehicle to perform. It turns out that recognizing lane markings on roads is possible using well known computer vision techniques. 

The goal of this project is to create a line that finds lane lines on the road.
